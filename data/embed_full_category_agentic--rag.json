Connect components (models, vector DBs, file converters) to pipelines or agents that can interact with your data. With advanced retrieval methods, it's best suited for building RAG, question answering, semantic search or conversational agent chatbots.","generated_at":"2026-02-10T17:38:19.582097937Z","latest_commit":{"ts":"2026-02-10T17:07:39Z","url":"https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/commit/b4fcae0648a038e3db267499ef5af4e39cfa392a"},"participation_stats":[18,25,11,23,13,19,24,21,24,18,19,10,8,12,23,9,17,9,7,15,9,10,5,22,7,13,12,10,7,10,8,9,10,5,9,26,31,33,25,29,24,31,25,34,23,2,16,49,36,34,24,30],"stars":24155,"topics":["agent","agents","ai","gemini","generative-ai","gpt-4","information-retrieval","large-language-models","llm","machine-learning","nlp","orchestration","python","pytorch","question-answering","rag","retrieval-augmented-generation","semantic-search","summarization","transformers"],"url":"https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack","first_commit":{"ts":"2019-11-14T10:42:51Z","url":"https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/commit/f5921548ba70ce735f95376e6a06c513327c6b44"},"languages":{"CSS":39330,"Gherkin":4662,"HCL":777,"HTML":91718,"JavaScript":76281,"Jinja":5351,"MDX":14357401,"Python":5390136,"Shell":1721,"TypeScript":12732},"latest_release":{"ts":"2026-01-27T09:14:25Z","url":"https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/releases/tag/v2.23.0"},"license":"Apache License 2.0"},"https://github.com/neuml/txtai":{"contributors":{"count":19,"url":"https://github.com/neuml/txtai/graphs/contributors"},"description":"💡 All-in-one AI framework for semantic search, LLM orchestration and language model workflows","generated_at":"2026-02-10T17:38:50.024804161Z","latest_commit":{"ts":"2026-02-10T17:20:32Z","url":"https://github.com/neuml/txtai/commit/bfd1f13f2b62624c6e480e7315d032c01fb55c23"},"participation_stats":[10,4,4,11,6,5,1,6,7,2,4,3,0,3,0,6,1,5,2,4,8,7,7,0,1,3,6,1,11,3,14,3,0,0,6,6,1,13,6,2,7,9,1,20,0,5,2,5,8,8,3,4],"stars":12126,"topics":["agents","ai","ai-agents","embeddings","information-retrieval","language-model","large-language-models","llm","nlp","python","rag","retrieval-augmented-generation","search","search-engine","semantic-search","sentence-embeddings","transformers","txtai","vector-database","vector-search"],"url":"https://github.com/neuml/txtai","first_commit":{"ts":"2020-08-09T19:13:59Z","url":"https://github.com/neuml/txtai/commit/319bda5c5cb5788c2de00ba553f1faea96873377"},"languages":{"Dockerfile":3276,"Makefile":2416,"Python":1166309},"latest_release":{"ts":"2026-01-23T17:03:50Z","url":"https://github.com/neuml/txtai/releases/tag/v9.4.1"},"license":"Apache License 2.0"},"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index":{"contributors":{"count":1847,"url":"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/graphs/contributors"},"description":"LlamaIndex is the leading framework for building LLM-powered agents over your data.","generated_at":"2026-02-10T17:38:56.116171943Z","latest_commit":{"ts":"2026-02-10T15:25:29Z","url":"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/commit/500eca1748117e20d75922023fb2502c4950eb4e"},"participation_stats":[45,7,54,46,37,36,36,32,29,17,21,52,49,41,57,45,44,43,34,46,34,41,36,32,17,31,37,22,15,24,33,23,33,41,23,21,23,34,17,10,16,9,13,8,14,18,6,8,17,24,38,25],"stars":46919,"topics":["agents","application","data","fine-tuning","framework","llamaindex","llm","multi-agents","rag","vector-database"],"url":"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index","first_commit":{"ts":"2022-11-02T04:25:10Z","url":"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/commit/4096aef10288fe04badfdbc1fedc43e3135c3363"},"languages":{"EdgeQL":3396,"HTML":57132,"JavaScript":85982,"Jupyter Notebook":9806982,"Makefile":444376,"Python":15690965,"Shell":3332,"Starlark":373,"Tree-sitter Query":17376},"latest_release":{"ts":"2026-01-21T20:44:52Z","url":"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/releases/tag/v0.14.13"},"license":"MIT License"}},"items":[{"category":"Agentic","homepage_url":"https://developers.llamaindex.ai/","id":"agentic--rag--llamaindex","logo":"logos/80ca01c453477042ca8fd917a69a6638bd8c4188262a49cf21b895b4335ce8a8.svg","name":"LlamaIndex","subcategory":"RAG","website":"https://developers.llamaindex.ai/","oss":true,"repositories":[{"url":"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index","primary":true}]},{"category":"Agentic","homepage_url":"https://haystack.deepset.ai/","id":"agentic--rag--haystack","logo":"logos/72f89d6277aa544d908cef0cb5cc6b5ddde56c53310e238513593cf3152e92cb.png","name":"Haystack","subcategory":"RAG","website":"https://haystack.deepset.ai/","oss":true,"repositories":[{"url":"https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack","primary":true}]},{"category":"Agentic","homepage_url":"https://neuml.github.io/txtai/","id":"agentic--rag--txtai","logo":"logos/8e0b639862198d780b08382ed66a88dbe7eb581f9e9e4a499f9b09b86cef5b0e.png","name":"txtai","subcategory":"RAG","website":"https://neuml.github.io/txtai/","oss":true,"repositories":[{"url":"https://github.com/neuml/txtai","primary":true}]}]}
